// TODO:
1. Ensure that other nodes can also set in the case principal (battery-test.py)
   goes down.
2. Each backup needs to copy new additions to dict into local storage.
3. Write serializer that saves new zone file entries on txt file (this is
   our version of "writing to disk")
4. Write DNS on top (lol) -- MORE SPECIFICS TO COME
5. Use one .py file for DNS, and let commandline args define if it is primary
   as well as its configs (self IP addr and port, list of other cluster IP a
   addrs and ports).
