// TODO:
1. Write serializer that saves new zone file entries on txt file (this is
   our version of "writing to disk")
2. Write DNS on top.
    - Parse zonefile and store entries in list (Emre: let me know how to choose
    to do this! Using a class sounds great.)
    - Need to write a Record class responsible for finding and formatting
      DNS records.
    - Ensure that when a DNS request is made, and the current node does not
      have an entry for that requested hostname in its zone file, use
      distributed_dict over RAFT to ask for information about the missing file.
      If other nodes do not propagate information about the hostname's mapping,
      return NX record. (Gabbi)
    - Ensure dnspython or dnslib libraries include a DNS server implementation
      which we could pass our resolver into; this DNSserver will handle requests
      done over tools like dig, and would be fantastic for demoing purposes!
